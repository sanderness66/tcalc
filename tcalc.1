.SH NAME
tcalc

.SH SYNOPSIS
tcalc expr ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tcalc
is a simple command line calculator that happens to understand numbers
in time stamp format. In other words, you can use
.B tcalc
to add, substract, multiply or divide ordinary numbers and/or time stamps.
It prints the result of the calculation both as a number (or as seconds, if you
will), and in "hms" notation.

Time durations can be in any of these formats (where
.I n
denotes any integer):

.TS
tab(|);
l l.
\fBcolon notation|
\fIn\fR|seconds
\fIn\fB:\fIn\fR|minutes and seconds
\fIn\fB:\fIn\fB:\fIn\fR|hours, minutes and seconds

\fBhms notation|
\fIn\fBs\fR|seconds
\fIn\fBm\fIn\fBs\fR|minutes and seconds
\fIn\fBh\fIn\fBm\fIn\fBs\fR|hours, minutes and seconds
.TE

Operators are the usual +, \-, *, / and % (and maybe others, I didn't
write the arithmetic evaluator).

.SH EXAMPLES

1. How long is 30 minutes plus 65 seconds?

.EX
$ tcalc 30m + 65s
1865 	 31m05s
.EE

2. If you slice an hour and twenty minutes into 30 equal parts, how
long is each part?

.EX
$ tcalc 1h20m / 30
160 	 02m40s
.EE

3. How long does
.I Sgt. Patate's
first 7 inch vinyl record run?

.EX
$ tcalc 03:17 + 01:47 + 01:47 + 02:45
576 	 09m36s
.EE

4. If I have a video clip that runs for 1h, 23m and 45s and split it
up in 10m chunks, how many 10m chunks will I get?

.EX
$ tcalc 1h23m45s / 10m
8 	 08s
.EE

Note that the
.I 08s
in this case doesn't mean anything, but
.B tcalc
doesn't know that. It's up to you to pick the result you need. Also note that
.B tcalc
rounds the answer down to the nearest integer.

5. And how much will be left over at the end?

.EX
$ tcalc 1h23m45s % 10m
225 	 03m45s
.EE

.SH BUGS
We make very little effort indeed checking for correct arguments, and
it's very easy to cause runtime panics by feeding
.B tcalc
with incorrect arguments.

.B tcalc
doesn't understand fractions of a second.
